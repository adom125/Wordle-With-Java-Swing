# Wordle-With-Java-Swing
This project is my own implementation of Wordle, a popular game that generates a five letter word that the user/player must guess in at most 6 tries. This project is written in Java and many components of Java Swing in order to make the game visual appealing and operable for the player. The user also has the ability to import a file through their computer directory and import a five letter word list of their own, or can use the preset five letter word options hardcoded.
